# Navigation-using-Aruco-Markers
The Python script task_6_qgis.py is a comprehensive program for tracking ArUco markers, storing their coordinates, calculating distances, and updating live data in a CSV file.

Key functionalities include:
Reading and writing CSV files containing marker IDs and their coordinates.
Detecting ArUco markers using OpenCV's ArUco module.
Estimating distances between a fixed marker (representing a reference point) and other markers.
Establishing a connection between an ESP32 device and the Python code.
Dynamically updating live data in a CSV file based on marker proximity.

Using QGIS software, the code displays the bot's real-time position, enabling accurate monitoring and navigation.
Overall, the script integrates computer vision techniques with data handling to facilitate real-time tracking and localization of ArUco markers, essential for various applications like robotics, augmented reality, and indoor navigation.
